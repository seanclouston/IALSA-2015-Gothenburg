The log of communication in the project


## 27 July 

Dear colleagues, 
  I have organized the contents of ours emails  and conversations into a github repository dedicated to the Gothenburg Retirement project. (the page after link will be referred to as the “main ReadMe” of the project )

  Please browse around, paying particular attention to the “News and Announcement” section where I’ve listed the links that would help you get up to speed with IALSA’s collaboration model on GitHub. 

  Essentially, GitHub repository is a collection of scripts and files. You can think of this repository as a Dropbox folder that has some special properties. One of such properties is automatic rendering and serving of webpages from the scripts and files of the project. For example, any *.md files will be automatically converted into html and served. All files with extension *.md can be edited directly in the web-browser, which allows for convenient crowd-sourcing. Other features, such as GitHub Issues, help organize tasks and manage human resources through its social platform.  

  In the next few days I would like to work on operationalizing our analytic strategy that would address the issues brought up by Scott and Sean. I will organize this development as a chain of Milestones and Issues and at this time invite you to start leaving feedback on Issues Forums as we are defining this project.  The intention is to unburden our emails and keep track of all communication and decisions pertaining to the planning and implementation of the project.  GitHub will be mayhem for a bit in the beginning, but it will pay off very fast. 

Your feedback and edits are welcome on any content of the repository.

Sean, Boo, and Magnus, please let me know if you would like me to walk with you through getting started with GitHub. If this is your first contact, it might be a bit disorienting (as others here can testify). But nothing a 15 minute talk can’t solve.  

Looking forward to a productive season!
Andrey
